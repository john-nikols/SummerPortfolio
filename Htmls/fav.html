					<h1>My Skills</h1>
					<h2>Web Design</h2><i class="fas fa-globe"></i>
					<p>I have been designing and coding websites for 3 years and counting. I have done projects that include
						HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and Javascript. I am continuing to learn new things as I go along in the Web Development and
						Web Desing path.
					</p> 
					
					<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
					<p>I am certified by the Utah Board of Education in screen printing and the use of the Adobe Suite software, 
						including InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. I enjoy making my own visuals, designs, and logos so that they look 
						professional and clean.
					</p>  
                       
					<h2>Computer Science</h2>
					<p>I am also certified in Computer Science by the Utah Board of Education. Those skills include basic computer knowledge,
						the use of word proccessing programs, and the knowledge of internet protocols. I am looking to further my knowledge of
						computer science to an even greater extent.
